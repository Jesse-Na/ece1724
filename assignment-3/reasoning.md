## Q1: Before coding, what did you think would be the hardest part?

I think the hardest part will be figuring out how to implement `routes`, specifically the request logic sent to the backend. For example, just from looking at the descriptions, I don't quite understand what it's saying when it talks about additional steps we must take when creating or updating a paper. This part also seems the most prone to miscellaneous errors, possibly due to my database configuration or something with Vite.

## Q2: Did you use AI?

- If YES: list the files or functions that were affected.
- If NO: write “No AI used” and briefly describe your approach or one challenge you encountered (1–2 sentences).

## Q3: (Only if you used AI) Choose one AI-generated output and explain what you changed and why.
