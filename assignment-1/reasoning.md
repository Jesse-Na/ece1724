## Q1: Before coding, what did you think would be the hardest part?

I think handling the pagination for the `GET /api/papers` will be the hardest
part of the assignment, partly because I've never done pagination before and
because I'm not sure yet how to build the SQL query to implement this.

## Q2: Did you use AI?

- If YES: list the files or functions that were affected.
- If NO: write “No AI used” and briefly describe your approach or one challenge you encountered (1–2 sentences).

No AI used. Whenever I was confused on how to implement a function, I would reference the lecture slides, official
developer docs, and stack overflow posts, to help me understand what a particular function like db.all did. I would
then play around with my implementation to see what worked and what didn't, using console logs and other debugging
tools to develop my understanding.

## Q3: (Only if you used AI) Choose one AI-generated output and explain what you changed and why.
