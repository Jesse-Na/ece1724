## Q1: Before coding, what did you think would be the hardest part?

I think handling the pagination for the `GET /api/papers` will be the hardest
part of the assignment, partly because I've never done pagination before and
because I'm not sure yet how to build the SQL query to implement this.

## Q2: Did you use AI?

-   If YES: list the files or functions that were affected.
-   If NO: write “No AI used” and briefly describe your approach or one challenge you encountered (1–2 sentences).

## Q3: (Only if you used AI) Choose one AI-generated output and explain what you changed and why.
