## Q1: Before coding, what did you think would be the hardest part?

I thought the hardest part would be figuring out all the types (e.g. PaperCreateData, ValidatedPaperQuery, etc.)
since the implementation seems to have many different types for the Paper table used by different parts of the app
(e.g. database.ts, papers.ts, middleware.ts, etc.). Getting them all correct seemed to be a lot of reading and
thinking about the code structure.

## Q2: Did you use AI?

- If YES: list the files or functions that were affected.
- If NO: write “No AI used” and briefly describe your approach or one challenge you encountered (1–2 sentences).



## Q3: (Only if you used AI) Choose one AI-generated output and explain what you changed and why.
